<h1>The Best Christmas Movies According to Brandon</h1>
    <h2>My top 4 Christmas movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Elf</h3>
<p>Zany with nonstop laughter. Will Ferrell at his best.</p>

<h3>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</h3>
<p>Comical with great chemistry between characters.</p>

<h3>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</h3>
<p>The animated and the live-action remake. They are both excellent and everyone should watch both of them...<br />
But, if you are only going to watch one, then make it the original animated masterpiece.

<h3>A Charlie Brown Christmas</h3>
<p>Heartwarming. You are never too old for this classic.</p>
